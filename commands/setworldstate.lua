    --FOR LATER: Battle Box: If the player has less than 20 unique cards in their storage, it puts in common cards to fill in the blanks. Here so that new players can play the card game immediately. Also dispenses the Rules Card, which is a hotlink to a manual for the trading card game.

    --Misc notes:
    --attempting to look at the factory will alias as c!look hallway or casino when in the hallway or casino. This is because the hallway, and the casino, are located in the factory.
